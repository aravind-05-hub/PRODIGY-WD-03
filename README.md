🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game – HTML, CSS, JavaScript
A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, game state management, and responsive design.

🚀 Features
🎯 2-player mode (Player X vs Player O)

🧠 Logic to detect win/draw conditions

🔄 Reset button to start a new game

📱 Responsive layout for various screen sizes

💡 Clean and modular code for easy customization

📂 Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the game layout

CSS3 – For styling the interface

JavaScript (Vanilla) – For implementing game logic and interactivity


🧠 How It Works
The game initializes a 3x3 grid dynamically.

Players take turns clicking on the cells to place their marker (X or O).

After each move, the script checks for a win or draw condition.

When the game ends, a message is displayed and the board can be reset.
